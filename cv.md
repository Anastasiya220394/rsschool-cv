## About me
I am 27 y.o. Live in Belarus, Minsk.
Recently I finished courses on developing web applications using the React library from Senla (duration 6 months, got free). The best students were given a mentor after completing the first home tasks, and I am among them, so I regularly receive a code review from my mentor. I try to absorb as much new information as possible and put into the practice. I good understand HTML5 and CSS(adaptive, responsive too) tags, styles, I have an analytical mindset, and I am not afraid of constructive criticism. I have good knowledge of JavaScript(ES6) and have some experience with Git. I wrote 2 applications in JS, and now I'm rewriting them in React.
Also I completed tasks in HtmlAcademy and Codecademy (HTML ans CSS). And now I continue to develop in RSSchool of EPAM (online courses). I watch many popular JavaScript teaching videos on Youtube.
For the last 5 years I worked as an accountant / logistician, but this January I quit my job to devote myself fully to development. I graduated from a linguistic college and have a degree in Psychology. In my experience I am very purposeful and patient in achieving any tasks. I have a high interest and motivation to follow a career as a developer.
